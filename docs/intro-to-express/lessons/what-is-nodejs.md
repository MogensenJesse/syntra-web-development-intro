## What is NodeJS

A server side runtime build for high concurrent APIs that are not CPU intensive.

- Node.js is JavaScript, it's async and event driven.
- Single threaded (can optimize)
- When kept async, Node can handle a high amount of concurrent request
- Not great for CPU intensive work (data crunching, ML, big maths)

### Advantages of NodeJS

1. Easy to Learn

Node is written in JavaScript. JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages and nearly every developer is familiar with it. Therefore, learning Node requires less effort and time, even for a junior JavaScript programmer.

2. Full Stack js

The rise of full stack web development can be accredited to Node. Full stack web development is when the same developer works on all aspects of the program: front-end development, back-end development, database administration, etc. Before Node, full stack developers had to learn multiple languages. With Node, you only need to know JavaScript to write both front- and back-end web applications.

3. Active Community

Node.js is an open source framework with a very active and vibrant community comprised of developers who continuously contribute to its improvement. That makes learning easier because you have access to numerous solutions at every stage of development.
